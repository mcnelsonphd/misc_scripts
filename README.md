misc_scripts
============

A collection of scripts I've made to do various processing of sequencing data.

demultiplex_reads.sh - Demultiplexes samples from non-demultiplexed MiSeq runs.
Relies on Qiime backend and a set of fixed mapping files to operate.

Per_Sample_Raw_Reads.sh - Creates raw read files for each sample of an amplicon sequencing experiment.
Relies on Qiime backend.
